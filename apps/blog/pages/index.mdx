## Dad. Developer. Dev.

Hello there! I'm a software engineer, born and raised in the sublime valleys of Roanoke, VA, but now dwelling in the Columbus area of Ohio. I'm currently working at [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/) as a Lead Software Engineer on the Application Platform Frontend team. When I have free time (which, as a new dad, is never), I enjoy noodling on React, Next.js, three.js, TypeScript, and generally all things frontend. I also love playing video games, cooking expensive-looking vegan food, and reading fantasy novels (currently working my way through Brandon Sanderson's [Stormlight Archives](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/)).

Occasionally I'll get the urge to write about something I've learned, interested in, or something I'm working on. If you're interested in that sort of thing, you can find my blog posts [here](/words).
