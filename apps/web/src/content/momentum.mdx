Last summer, I read Marianne Bellotti's "Kill It With Fire: Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)." As the title suggests, the book is filled with hardened wisdom on how to deal with legacy systems.

One of the core themes of the book is when and how to rewrite versus when to manage or maintain. Bellotti writes:

"Many people try to fix things which are not, in fact, broken. Don't optimize beyond diminishing returns. Modernization needs momentum to finish the job."

It's this last nugget of wisdom that has resonated most strongly with me. Never underestimate the power of momentum, or the lack thereof.

Around the time I was reading this, the team I worked on was effectively moving from one fire to the next. We oversaw frontend architecture for a mid-sized health tech company, and to be completely fair, our systems were far from legacy.

Some parts of the stack were fairly old, but they were mostly backend systems or aging databases. The fires my team extinguished were (mostly) from a not-even 3-year-old monolithic frontend application. The technology was far from "legacy." In fact, it was a relatively up-to-date Next.js application at its core. However, in less than 3 years, it had gone from a shiny new replacement for the prior monolith to a dumpster fire filled with hundreds of inconsistent components, intertwined state management systems, bespoke utilities hacking over tech debt, and orphaned experiments.

We had a dozen different header components, four different primary colors, and no consistent styling standard.

Many of these problems were product-related, such as not using our in-house design system to build things. However, just as many issues were due to engineers working to bolt feature on top of feature between tight deadlines. As a result, the application performed horribly. Running a local dev instance (on an M1) was impossible. If you tried to run tests locally, your laptop would crash.

I remember that in the first couple of months, I decided to check the Lighthouse scores one day. When I saw they weren't even in double digits at the time, I asked my teammate how we could possibly be functioning like this.

His answer? Oh, we just cache the heck out of every page.

Things weren't all bad. At the same time, my team owned a monorepo for our design system, extension libraries, some utilities, and other reusable frontend functionality. We'd spent around half the year taking that monorepo and making it fast, easy, and satisfying to work in. We had a dream of scaling it to the rest of the organization, but it seemed nearly impossible to get anyone to stop working in silos. Even the teams that knew it was a better place to build in still didn't because of "pressure to ship features in the monolith."

To put it bluntly, the engineering organization was ripe for burnout.

Let's pause here a moment. Picture yourself in my shoes. You're a lead engineer on a platform team in charge of making the frontend cohesive and performant. You see the writing on the wall if the monolith continues down the track it's going. You're dealing with overwhelming negative momentumâ€”momentum toward an unfavorable outcome. What would you do?

One knee-jerk reaction is to rewrite the whole thing. As Bellotti points out above, this is usually not the correct answer. Not only would it likely take too long to be effective, but it wouldn't look particularly good for our team to abandon the rest of the frontend in search of greener pastures while all of the active product teams suffered. Also, at the end of the day, if we can't fix the underlying systemic problems, what's to prevent the rewrite from becoming the same as the current system? Technical standards and guardrails are only effective if the organization is accountable to them.

Another option would be to maintain and improve the current system. This might work; however, we realized our small team would have to focus entirely on this to be effective. This had already been our strategy for around six months, and we were fighting a losing battle against the tide. People were contributing tech debt faster than we could clean things up and standardize.

To decide, we asked ourselves, "How can we best set ourselves up for success in 12 months' time?"

In other words, how can we shift the momentum in a positive direction?

## Refactoring

We settled somewhere in the middle. We first had to staunch the blood loss to prevent what Bellotti might call existential risk (problems that endanger the health of the company), so we spent a focused month analyzing and triaging the critical issues in the monolith. During the same time, we worked with leads across the organization to begin a paradigm shift. We showcased the vast difference in developer experience between working in the monolith and working in our monorepo. This, combined with key buy-in from some engineering leadership, sparked a shift in the momentum. Other teams began to see the danger we were in and felt confident enough to push for something better.

That said, many teams weren't ready or capable of fully shifting their development processes. To tackle this, we set up a transitional stage for teams to build inside the monolith (in decomposed packages), but in ways that were decoupled from the core of the application so that their functionality remained isolated and would be easy to migrate in the future.

After a couple of months of this, we felt confident we could leave the monolith alone to focus on our ideal state. We knew that in this time, the monolith would likely continue to degrade, but the hope was we had slowed the problem enough that we could refocus our efforts on providing standards and a vastly improved experience outside of the monolith.

To that end, rather than rewrite, we took a refactoring approach.

I instructed our team to place a core emphasis on systems and standards, experimenting with what worked well within our stack currently and polishing our experience around that. We brought in tooling like Turborepo, Changesets, and a "pages as package" approach to application building. Standard after standard was initialized, and at every step of the way, we invited the community to have a say in working groups so that our architecture wasn't too top-down.

We continued to showcase small improvements, compounding on the positive momentum we'd already generated.

Many of the improvements are more subjective, but one key figure that improved was around CI times. At the beginning of 2021, it took nearly an hour to build and deploy changes in the monorepo (from PR checks running to publish). That's completely discounting review time. For some more fundamental packages (like the design system), that time could reach as high as an hour and a half. We were synchronously building and testing around 15 packages. If you think that's bad, the monolith took 2-3 hours just to deploy to production (not even counting checks run in the PR).

Now, our monorepo builds, lints, typechecks, and tests 40+ packages concurrently in only **5-10 minutes**. It also only runs tasks on what's actually changed, mostly thanks to Turborepo. Similarly, our deploy process takes around 7 minutes on average, publishing 40+ packages and deploying numerous micro applications.

At the same time, the perception of our team changed. Prior to my joining, our team was viewed as "gatekeepers" to the frontend, and as things got worse, we were inevitably blamed for some of the failings of the architecture. Whether this was merited or not, it was technically our responsibility, so it's not entirely an unfair statement.

This all changed for the better as we gained momentum.

## Conclusions

Fast forwarding to now, things are in a much better state. We still have our monolith, but we're in the process of migrating off it. The monorepo is flourishing, and we're constantly engaged in defining new best practices or innovating within our own architecture. Teams are engaged and see the frontend as not only something that is constantly evolving for the better, but something they truly have a stake in.

Bringing it back to the quote at the top of this article, the modernization of our architecture would not have been possible had it not been for us responding with equal severity to the problems we were facing. We made it clear that things needed to change, but we didn't set out to fade into the background and design some miracle solution while everyone else toiled away.

No, we brought the organization along with us step by step to see that change was happening. This fed back as confidence for our team that we were moving forward.

I hope this lesson will resonate with someone out there. No situation like this is the same, but looking back, the focus on momentum set the stage for transformative processes. If you find yourself struggling against the current of degrading systems, take a step back and ask yourself:

"How can we best set ourselves up for success in 12 months?"

"How can we shift the momentum?"
