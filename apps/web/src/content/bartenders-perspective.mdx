My story into software is slightly unusual. Like most [zillennials](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Zillennial), I've been around computers my whole life, tinkering and whatnot, similarly for coding. But, despite always wanting to immerse myself in it, the industry itself alluded me.

I did the formal 4 year academic thing, earning a _Bachelor of Arts_ (tips teacup) in Computer Science from Oberlin College. Graduating felt grand. A couple months after graduating, not so much. I floundered around, riding the winds to Madison, WI with a couple close friends. I played copious amounts of Diablo 3 and repeatedly said that I was just relaxing for a minute before I found a job. This was true, but only stays reasonable for a short period of time.

Long story short, it took me time to find my way into formal software engineering. I dabbled, taking part time contract work or freelance web development but never fully committing. To supplement this, I often did odd jobs, everything from gardening to a surprisingly lucrative compost business to eventually bartending. Similar to my gaming addiction, I always told myself it was temporary. Bartending, however, was different. I fell in love with the rhythm of the bar, the intricacies and details of mixology and the optimality of the trade. Though I don't still professionally tend bar today, I learned a lot in my years as a bartender, and much of it transfered in ways that made me the engineer I am today. It was something I was surprisingly both intrigued by _and_ good at. Unlike the other odd jobs I'd done, this one had an artistry to it, and the skill ceiling was much higher. I poured myself into bartending, getting reasonably good over the 3 years I practiced. I primarily worked at an upscale steakhouse, which is important because 1.) the volume was high enough I could practice under pressure and 2.) I had access to quality tools, ingredients, and liquors. Tending bar shares a lot of strange parallels with software. Consistency and reusability, for example, but I'll write on that another time.

It was this artistry and craving for knowledge that ultimately led me _back_ into tech. However, now that I've been in tech for a bit, there are some things that are, plainly, wild to consider as a bartender looking in.

## Foundation

Both bartending and software require foundational knowledge before you can even begin to begin to succeed. On the surface, that might not appear the case.

You might say, "But I can make a drink--it's not that hard." And this is true. Any scrub can follow a margarita recipe from the comfort of their home and serve it in makeshift glass, impressing friends or spouse with a flourish and a poorly cut lime. However, go to a craft cocktail bar and ask for the same drink. Watch the execution in particular, and the end result. The same analogies could be said for software development. It's not particularly difficult to read a guide and deploy a website or make a Hello World application, especially these days.

I digress, though. I'm not here to gatekeep bartending or engineering. Personally, my take is once you start doing it, you are it (you just might be an amateur or lacking proper training/equipment).

The point is that in either case there's foundational knowledge and tooling required to begin the craft. When I was taught to bartend, before I was allowed to do anything on my own I had to learn from the ground up. Spirits, wine, beer, mixers, garnishes, bar tools, bar speak, measuring. The list goes on. Even the seemingly straightforward things have to be learned. For example, pouring. I had to learn how to _pour_ again. Stirring, too.

Even after learning many of these things at a basic level, I had to master each before I things really clicked.

In my experience, the same is true in software engineering (and likely many other trades).

## Rhythm

Once I mastered each element, I was able to start doing these things automatically, without consciously thinking. Much like driving a car. This frees up the mind to go deeper and start to master more macro level abilities. In software, this is like mastering a programming language and beginning to _develop_. You no longer spend intimate time thinking about syntax for the specific language, and instead see the bigger picture of what you're building. The programming part comes automatically.

It's at this stage that I started getting into the rhythm of the bar. Loosely speaking, it's the "flow state". Developers love talking about and thinking about flow, so I can hardly pass up a chance for this comparison.

One (potential) difference, though: flow behind the bar is not solitary--far from it. In many ways it's more like a dance or performance, where you and your coworkers all must move together, a single unit. There's an overarching rhythm to the act of tending the bar, and this rhythm is only a single melody playing in harmony with the grand orchestra of the restaurant or business. All this to say, collaboration is not only important, not only required, but an underpinning to the trade itself.

Arguably, this is true in software as well, though there's a strange perception that software engineering is an individual sport, performed completely in silos with explicitly little human interaction. While this might be the story we tell (or the one told for us), it is far from the truth. It may be the truth for _some_ developers, but I wager that's the exception and not the norm. The rhythm might be stretched out over days, weeks, even months instead of hours, but it is still there pounding away in the background.

It takes the form of slack threads, pairing, of scrum meetings, of GitHub discussions, architecture and code review, arguments over approaches, and so on. Understanding and embracing that rhythm is one of the most important lessons I was taught as a bartender, and it undoubtedly made me a better engineer. There's a delicate balance that plays out between deep work and collaboration in programming, and mastering that balance is key to professional success.

## Management

Management in software engineering is somewhat of a tossup. It _seems_ like the responses on what good management is vary widely. In both bartending and software, management can make or break a team.

Behind the bar, a great manager is one that intuits when to stay the fuck away from the bar and when to help out.

There's an exact amount of space behind the bar, and the bar staff know precisely how to dance in it such that no space is wasted. There's a symbiosis between bartenders as well, where good bartenders will move fluidly together, never missing a beat. In its ideal state, it's a perfect, closed system. Add in a foreign body to that rhythm and chaos ensues.

I had an assistant manager that was terrible about this. He knew our drinks well enough, but did not respect the space and rhythm. He'd take every opportunity to try and "help" behind the bar when things looked even slightly busy. In doing this, he'd throw the whole system off balance. Tools would be misused. Glasses would break. Liquors would be put back in slightly different places, causing confusion down stream. Plus the additional literal body moving against the current. What might help with an initial rush in the night would ruin hours of preparation and leave us playing catch up for the rest of the night.

If instead we'd just slowed down and taken the initial rush at a slightly slower pace (and our manager stayed the fuck out of the bar), we'd have remained prepared and organized. This goes back to the consistency I spoke of before. Good bartending is about managing the incoming work evenly. It is infinitely better to make 10 consistent drinks in good form, keeping your space orderly and ready to go for the next rush than to make 15 inconsistent drinks in chaos, assuring your fate of playing catch up when you inevitably run out of a critical ingredient or misplace something.

I mentioned that the key difference is knowing when to stay out and when to help. When _should_ a manager help out? A good manager _reduces_ chaos when things start to get out of control. They are the equalizer when external chaos threatens the rhythm of the bar, and more globally, the restaurant. Here are a couple examples:

1. Dishes stacking up on the bar due to a large reservation unexpecedtedly deciding to eat at the bar instead of their table. Great manager efficiently removes the dishes while chatting with guests.
2. Bartender slips and breaks a glass behind the bar during a rush. Manager _calmly_ cleans up the glass and replaces any affected stock, allowing bar to keep focus on the rush.

## Concluding Thoughts

I wrote this to philosophize on similarities between trades that, at first glance, appear entirely different. It's easy to bucket physical, craftsmanlike work as a divergent beast from knowledge work, but we'd be missing out to do so. Worse, our society commonly associates such trades as inferior. We place less value on them both economically and culturally, which is both unfortunate and shameful.

There's a lot to learn from the craftsmen of the world. The next time you're out at a bar or restaurant, pay attention to the frenzy. Try and feel out the rhythms.
