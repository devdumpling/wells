# Wells

My personal frontend monorepo.

## What?

It's probably overkill (no, it most certainly is), but I work day in and day out in frontend monorepos. I've grown accustomed to working in them and thought, "you know what, I might as well shove my personal work into one too."

And so `wells` was born.

## Deployment

All sites are deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com). When merging to main in the monorepo, only apps that change will kick off a deployment.

Packages are deployed to npm.

- main: [https://www.helloim.dev](https://www.helloim.dev)
- blog: [https://helloim.dev/blog](https://blog.helloim.dev/blog)
- docs: [https://helloim.dev/docs](https://docs.helloim.dev/docs)

- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) for managing the monorepo

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for packages, components, and so forth
- [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) for bundling packages (powered by esbuild)
